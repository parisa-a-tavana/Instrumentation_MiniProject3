# Instrumentation_MiniProjects
In this project, we use STM32CubeIDE and Proteus 8 Professional to program a MCU and simulate it.
Q1: We create 2 blinking LEDs.
Q2: We create 2 LEDs that are controlled by two push up buttons.When we push the first button, the green LED turns on and the red LED turns off.
When we push the second button, the red LED turns on and the green LED turns off.
Q3: We create 2blinking LEDs controlled by two push up buttons. When we push the second button, it turns to only the red LED blinking and when we push the first 
button, it turns back to normal.
Q4: We use an lcd library to show a name and a student ID on an lcd.
Q5: We create a timer that counts to 50 and resetes, we show the timer on lcd.
Q6: We use the timer of the MCU as a counter that counts the number of times a button is pushed without using interrupt.
